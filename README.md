# Visualizing The Cases & Mortality of COVID-19 in USA in a global context.
 This work uses the D3 library of JavaScript to represent the number of cases and mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States of America using adequate and proper visualization schemes. The visualation used real data available drawn from a reputable source (refer to ReadME) with the caveat that all the data points are staticâ€” i.e. the data is not drawn from a soucre with real time updates. So the statistics shown pertains to the year 2020, at the time the project was undertaken. To run the visualization use the index.html file and run it on a localhost. The project itself was submitted as my course project for Information Visualization taught by Professor Xianbin Gu at NYU Shanghai for the Fall of 2020. The author may revisit this project to expand upon the breadth and depth of what had been done.
